<br> As a current Data Analyst for organic and inorganic acquisitions at Vacasa, I work on a multitude of projects that require creative thinking, problem-solving, and creating new processes that are then documented for future tasks/acquisitions. I thrive in situations that allow for intellectual creativity and the pursuit of goals to be completed.<br> 
<br>I am also a firm believer in a healthy/work-life balance that includes regular exercise, hydration, and travel. To complement my professional pursuits of career growth and education, I balance that with travel to new and loved places along with relaxing at home with my two overly-spoiled cats. <br>
<br> If you are interested in connecting, please take a look at my resume and Linkedin, both of which are available below.
